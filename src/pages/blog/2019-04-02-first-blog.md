I've never had a blog before... Well why now?

### 4 reasons I'm starting a blog (and you should too)

#### 1. Improve skilz

English was always my worst subject. In year 7, I remember mum trying to comfort me by saying not to worry as she was bad at English too. It was just who I was. You can imagine with that mindset, English kept being my worst subject till the end of year 12.

I've come to realise maybe I'm not bad at English. Maybe I just did terrible with that assignment. I don't want that to define me anymore. I want to improve and I've got to start somewhere.

#### 2. Declutter my mind

It pains me to say this but sometimes I miss high school. I miss the projects where we had to prepare something (like a poster, report or speech) about a topic (like a country, a histrical figure or a book). I miss the process of gathering, filtering and rearranging information.

As a procratinator, I was always too frantic to apprieciate what I learnt, in fact I was just young to actually apprieciate anything (sorry mum I apprieciate you now).

There are so many things and ideas I want to expore and triage. I want to Marie Kondo my head. I think this blog will help me focus on topics that I'm genuienly interested in.

#### 3. Sharing is caring

Maybe one day someone will read this. That person might be inspired or think differently or even learn something. If that happens what will make me very happy.

#### 4. Let's have strangers judge you

Working in the Tech industy it's neccessay to have an online precense. Self promotion is key. I have to admit my online presence is very minimal. I have all the accounts I'm supposed to as a programmer (twitter, github, linkedIn). I don't regularly use them and I don't have anything worth mentioning.... But this blog... This blog will change that..for the better... I hope...
